# Farm-elp
## Android Application made by Pranshu Sahu

# Description :-

I have made this application by thinking of some basic fundamental problem faced by the farmer while selling the product.
I will list my views below :
This application focuses on the need of the farmer for selling the products. 
User need to register to the application by giving the details asked like : email, phone number, adhaarID, etc.
Once the registration is done along with basic validation, It is then verified by the team whether it is a valid seller or not based on there criteria ( functionality not yet added ).
On successful registration the user can login the application using email and password provided.
The valid seller ( farmers, vendors, etc) are allowed to add or update there products to the site according to the description provided.
The new products are then verified by the team ( team not available so functionality not added ). Once verified, the team notifies the seller and updates the details on site for buyers access.
This application gives the power to handle all the type of transaction directly from both ends : seller and buyer. (both should be registered ).
For successful interaction the necessary details are shared with each other.
Once the seller approves for the connection with the buyer then the contact details of seller are shared with the buyer and the contact is saved in buyers contact list.
They both can contact to each other directly from the application for further enquiry.
Enquiry and negotiation can be done via chat also (functionality not added yet).
Now for the selling point of view as to where a seller would sell his products, it depends on the location provided for selling.
Then the products that are seen by the buyers in the list is also dependent on the location he is in and the products available at that location.
…. and many more functionalities to be added.
