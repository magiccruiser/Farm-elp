# Farm-elp
## Android Application made by using java, firebase, XML on android studio

# Description :-

I have made this application by thinking of some basic fundamental problem faced by the farmer while selling the product.
I will list my views below :

##### * This application focuses on the need of the farmer for selling the products. 

##### * User need to register to the application by giving the details asked like : email, phone number, adhaarID, etc.

##### * Once the registration is done along with basic validation, It is then verified by the team whether it is a valid seller or not based on there criteria ( functionality not yet added ).

##### * On successful registration the user can login the application using email and password provided.

##### * The valid seller ( farmers, vendors, etc) are allowed to add or update there products to the site according to the description provided.

##### * The new products are then verified by the team ( team not available so functionality not added ). Once verified, the team notifies the seller and updates the details on site for buyers access.

##### * This application gives the power to handle all the type of transaction directly from both ends : seller and buyer. (both should be registered ).

##### * For successful interaction the necessary details are shared with each other.

##### * Once the seller approves for the connection with the buyer then the contact details of seller are shared with the buyer and the contact is saved in buyers contact list.

##### * They both can contact to each other directly from the application for further enquiry.

##### * Enquiry and negotiation can be done via chat also (functionality not added yet).

##### * Now for the selling point of view as to where a seller would sell his products, it depends on the location provided for selling.

##### * Then the products that are seen by the buyers in the list is also dependent on the location he is in and the products available at that location.

â€¦. and many more functionalities to be added.
